- it has a broader scope than other more focused systems
- it has a huge amount of data that makes its identification more accurate
- it has a large community of experts that can help others identify species

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
- it uses computer vision

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
- Some of my personal ideas:
 - more info about species/animal groups
 - for Seek: put in unidentified observations
   - focus taxonomical groups
   - create identification games
 -  


* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

- People would be able to track ambiguous species
- taxonomical groups give a framework for learning about new animale

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
