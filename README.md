* Founders
    * iNaturalist.org began as the Master's final project of Ken-ichi Ueda, Nate Agrin, and Jessica Kline at UC Berkeley's School of Information
    * After graduation, they received additional help from Sean McGregor

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
    * It started as a master's project by students of UC Berkley school of information
* Funding
    * When iNaturalist was joined with the California Academy of Sciences and National Geographic Society they recieved funding from these institutions
    * They became an independent nonprofit in 2023, after receiving 10 million dollars of funding from Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    * According to their about page, "iNaturalist is an online social network of people sharing biodiversity information to help each other learn about nature."
    * It performs the following functions:
        *  help people to identify plants/animals/fungi they observe in nature
            * AI can helpe with the initial identification
        * allows communtiy members to review photos and other relavent info(sounds, location, time of photo etc. ) to help identify species
        * provides data gathered by members of the community to researchers
    * Sources: https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/about, personal exploration of the apps

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
    * iNaturalist has a few different target audiences:
        * Non-experts with an interest in ecology and/or community science are able to:
            * engage with nature
            * identify the species they encounter
            * contribute their observations to science
            * view plant and animal observations others have contributed
        * Those with more expert knowledge can also contribute to the platform by helping correctly identify and label different species
        * Researchers are able to use the data from iNaturalist to make new discoveries
        * iNaturalist's sister app Seek is targeted more towards children and families. It does not have the social media aspect of iNaturalist, but allows users to upload pictures and have access to iNaturalist's AI to help with species identification. 
    * Since this app is open and free to the public the target audience is extremely broad and is meant to be as inclusive as possible

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
    * Since iNaturalist is a non-profit funded by donations, it can provide its services to a large number of people for free
    * iNaturalist has a very broad scope, people can post about any animal, plant, or fungi they encounter
    * iNaturalist is widely used and has therefore generated a huge amount of data. This allows its Ai to be trained more accurately and provides more data for researchers
    * iNaturalist has a large community of people that can help others accurately identify species

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
    * it uses computer vision


## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
   * iNaturalist seems to overlap with a few different fields including education and science. The Ai field specifically is image recognition, specifically image recognition for species identification. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
    * The use of Ai for education and species identification is a fairly new innovation to the field. iNaturalist began working with Ai in 2016.

* What are the other major companies in this field?
- Wildbook
- picture _(bird, insect, etc.) - environmental education
- Merlin Bird(Cornell lab of ornthology)

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
    * encouraged community participation with nature 
    * created an extensive database of identified species
        * on April 2017 had 5,000,000 veriable observations and is still growing
        * at least 73,000 distinct species
        * this database is useful both for research and for helping to continue improvements on their AI system

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
 * database size(see above)
 * accuracy of database
    * it is estimated that about 95% of their research grade observations are accurate
 * accuracy of AI
    * there is variation based on location, but the AI system tends to perform relatively well on a huge variety of taxa
    * the AI has consistantly improved in the last several years

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
    * While some others applicaitons such as Merlin Bird Id are better at identifying specific taxa, iNaturalist is one of the best at recognising a wide range of organisms

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
    * I think iNaturalist and Seek are really good at what they do. If I were to add something, maybe I would add more general educational resources so people could research and learn how to identify different species. This could include: 
        * key information about ways of distinguishing taxa
        * games to help people learn these skills
        * tests that demonstrate people's profiency at identifying certain taxa

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    * Helping train people to identify animals will help educate the public, which helps them be a better community resource
    * providing training on the platform could lead people to more accurately idenitify the organisms people post.
    * people who had passed tests verifying their ability to identify species could have their input weighted more, and therefore help improve the websites database. This could help both provide better data for researchers and give them more information to improve their own Ai systems. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

    * This could just use more of their basic website architecture 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
    * These tests could easily be made as another feauture on their website or with an additional app
